# Hello world

Here it is _Garn_, a **web developer** from _Valencia_ in love with minimalism.

## Professional Experience

I began coding in 2006 during my Engineering studies at UPV, working with foundational programming languages. Over the years, I have evolved into a web developer who values minimalism and efficiency. My experience spans building dynamic user interfaces, developing backend services, and optimizing applications for performance. Currently, I am contributing my skills as a developer at [harbiz](https://harbiz.io), where I focus on delivering innovative web solutions.

## Tech stack

I am deeply convinced that embracing web standards is the future of development. My focus is on modern web technologies that enhance user experience and performance. I have a strong interest in advancements that push the boundaries of what's possible on the web, and I am enthusiastic about tools that simplify development and deployment processes.
